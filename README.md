# rectangle_example

This little app finds the intersection, containment and adjacency between two rectangles

# How it works

This app calculates if two rectangles are in intersection, containment, or adjacency. The main idea is find the *topRight* and the *bottomLeft* with their points [x,y] where you can find out the collision between each other and identify which one is the corresponding intersection, containment or adjacency.
